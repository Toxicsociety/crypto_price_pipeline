_Crypto Price Pipeline

A simple Python script that fetches the current Bitcoin and Ethereum prices from the CoinGecko API and stores them in a SQLite database. This project demonstrates basic API usage, JSON handling, and SQL data storage.

_How It Works
1. Fetch crypto prices from the CoinGecko API  
2. Clean the JSON response  
3. Save the data to `crypto_prices.db` with a timestamp  

_Run the Script
```bash
python main.py
